A simple Django-based project for managing student records with custom authentication, logging, and admin features.

---

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository  
2. Make sure you have **Python 3.8** and **Django 4.2.23** installed  
3. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   
## Getting Started
1. Register a new user from the UI
2. Login using the registered user
3. Create a superuser using the terminal:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser

## Features
1. Alert messages for login, create, update, and delete
2. Logs stored in a separate table
3. Minimal logs displayed on a dedicated screen
4. Duplicate (name + subject) entries update existing data
5. Validates marks (must be between 0â€“100)
6. Inline editing feature
7.Admin panel shows key data without opening records

## Security Considerations
1. Custom decorator for login-required views
2. Custom session-based login with hashed passwords
3. @never_cache used to block access to protected pages after logout

## Challenges Faced
1. Hashing and verifying custom passwords
2. Handling superuser login with custom auth
3. Building UI with basic frontend skills (minimal but usable)

## Time Taken
Approximately 15 hours (setup was quick due to prior experience)
